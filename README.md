### What's this repo about?

This is project #2 of Udacity's deep reinforcement learning nanodegree. The goal here is to create an agent that learns how to catch a moving target. Every time step that the agent's double-jointed arm is on the target the agent gets a reward of +0.1.

The state space has 33 dimensions (position, rotation, velocity, and agular velocities of the arm). Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions. The action space has 4 dimensions; each entry corresponds to the torque of one joint of one arm and can vary from -1 to +1.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, the agent must get an average score of +30 over 100 consecutive episodes.

### Dependencies

1. [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/). It has to be 3.6 (3.5 or 3.7 won't work, because of PyTorch and Unity ML-Agents Toolkit).

2. [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)

3. [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

4. [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)

5. [Unity ML-Agents Toolkit](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents), which is an open-source plugin that enables games and simulations to serve as environments for training intelligent agents. Download their Banana app from one of the links below.

    (_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the environment.

### Replication instructions

Install all dependencies, download `main.py`, `ddpg_agent.py`, and `model.py`, put it all in the same folder, add the Reacher app to that folder, and run `python main.py`.
